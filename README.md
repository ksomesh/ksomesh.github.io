PROJECTS
AUTOMATE BMR ISO CREATION
1. For BMR restores, we provide a WinPE based ISO after installing various software, Drivers etc.
2. These ISOs were managed manually along with all the components, such as Drivers etc.
3. Multiple machines(6) were maintained per release to support this. This also had the risk of losing
things in case of a crash etc.
4. Automated the whole thing. Now ISO can be created with just few clicks
5. This helped in introducing continuous integration. Made components upgrades smooth and easy.
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT FOR FAILED/COMMIT FILE PROCESSING
1. With multiple file system calls to collect metadata introduced overtime, Processing failed and
commit file entry was taking lots of time
2. As Failed/commit file entry can be in millions and filesystem calls are costly. This was taking a dig
at performance.
3. Improved the performance by caching the metadata locally after collecting it from first call or from
previous record and using it from cache for subsequent passes
TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT FOR BMR
1. Added support for two factor authentication in BMR
SAML LOGIN SUPPORT FOR APPLICATION
1. Added SAML login for various applications like Migration assistant etc.
NDMP Snapshot Management Extension For Cluster-mode ONTAP
1. This Extension helps users to completely manage their Snapshot (i.e. point in time image of their
file system) using NDMP protocol.
2. Messages developed under this extension can be used to create snapshot, delete Snapshot, Recover
from snapshot etc.
HIGHLIGHT : QA Reported Not a Single BUG on this Project after completing functional testing
Cache prefetch depending on nature of Workloads(Prototype)
1. The project’s aim was to efficiently utilize cache in a multi user environment.
2. Depending on the nature of workload (serial /parallel access), box will suggests user to turn their
pre caching on/off.
Data Backup with Rolling Baselines (US9836230B2 - Data backup with rolling baselines - Google Patents)
1. This method reduces the restore window for multilevel Backups and even provides
Data Protection Admin option to tune Backup and Restore Window according to their
Highlights: Filed patent for the same
Vseeding (1st prize DPG innovation challenge)
1. Designed and prototyped a new way to seed data by using virtual instances of ONTAP and
existing ONTAP features.
2. Traditional seeding involves performing a smtape (physical) backup to tape, transporting the tape
physically to another geographic location and performing a restore from the tape.
3. With evolved clustered ONTAP systems, this provides an alternate to investing resources in
smtape backups.
REST BASED HDID REMOTE CLI:
1. Designed and developed REST BASED REMOTE CLI for HDID(Hitachi Data Instance Director).
2. Used Command and chain of responsibility Design pattern to achieve a good maintainable code.
CAPACITY MANAGEMENT FOR WORKLOAD MIGRATION
1. Using this feature RMM decides which is the best suited Host to migrate the workload to and
migrate the later there
2. Supported All Workload Migration on ESX (vmware)
3. Supported DRS configured clusters of Vmwar
